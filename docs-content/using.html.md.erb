This topic describes how to push and bind an application to an AppDynamics tile.


## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Before You Start

1. Create a [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account if you do not have one.

1. Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). See [Installing the cf CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).


## <a id='log-in-to-pivotal-cli'></a> Log In to the Pivotal CLI

1. Open a cf CLI or command-prompt window.

1. Identify your Pivotal API endpoint and version. Enter the following command:
  <pre class='terminal'>$ cf api</pre>
  You should see the following output:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  api endpoint: https://api.my.pivotal.io
  api version: 2.103.0
  </pre>

1. Log in to the Pivotal endpoint:
  <pre class='terminal'>cf login</pre>

1. Enter your email address and Pivotal password when prompted.


## <a id='push-the-application'></a> Push the Application

1. `cd` into the root directory of the application you want to deploy.

1. Push the application and the [corresponding buildpack](using.html#buildpack-info):
  <pre class='terminal'>cf push <app-name> -b <url-to-appdynamics-buildpack></pre>


## <a id='bind-the-service-plan-to-the-application'></a> Bind the Service Plan to the Application

1. Log in to Pivotal Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to **Marketplace > AppDynamics**.

1. Under **Service Plans**, select the service plan that you set up in Ops Manager. Click **Select This Plan**.

  The Service tab confirms that the service is successfully bound to the application.

## <a id='restage-the-application'></a> Restage the Application

1. Run the following command:
  <pre class='terminal'>cf bind-service <application-name></pre>

1. Check the resulting output and verify that the app is successfully deployed. The last lines should confirm that the state of the app is running.
  <pre class='terminal'>
       state     since                  cpu    memory        disk           details
  #0   running   2018-02-15T02:06:03Z   0.0%   55.3M of 1G   341.7M of 1G
  </pre>


## <a id='setting-proxy-properties'></a> Setting Proxy Properties

If you are using a proxy server, the consumer application should specify the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` as an environment variable for the application running on PCF to communicate with the proxy server. Do the following:

1. Set the environment variable for the application and the Controller.
   * For an HTTP proxy:
    <pre class='terminal'>cf set-env <app-name> http_proxy http://user@password:myproxy....:8080/</pre>
   * For an HTTPS proxy:
    <pre class='terminal'>cf set-env <app-name> https_proxy https://user@password:myproxy....:8080/</pre>

1. Restage the application:
    <pre class='terminal'>cf restage <app-name></pre>

1. Log in to the Controller web UI, navigate to the Metric Browser, and verify that the application is being detected and monitored.
