<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions for installing AppDynamics v1.x, see <a href="./installing_1_x.html">(Deprecated) Installing and Configuring AppDynamics APM (1.x version)</a>.</p>

This topic describes how to install and configure AppDynamics APM monitoring in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).


## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Before You Start

Create a [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account if you do not have one.


## <a id='SSL'></a> Configuring SSL

If you are planning to use SSL, do the following based on the Controller type.

### <a id='SAAS'></a> SSL for SaaS AppDynamics Controllers

AppDynamics SaaS controller use DigiCert Global Root CA. The tile automatically imports the DigiCert Global Root CA into the keystore used by AppDynamics Machine Agent and the dashboard app, if present.

Enable the SSL checkbox in AppDynamics Machine Agent configuration.

### <a id='OnPrem'></a> SSL for OnPremise AppDynamics Controllers

For OnPremise Controller deployments, upload the root certificate for the internal CA that signed the Controller certificate for your OnPremise Controller in the secutiry configuration of the BOSH Director.

For an example, see the [Security Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/vsphere-config.html#security-config) section of the _Configuring Ops Manager Director on vSphere_ topic in the PCF documentation.

Make sure to follow the exact format below while entering multiple certificates.
