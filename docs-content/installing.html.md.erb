This topic describes how to install and configure Appdynamics APM monitoring in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).


## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Before You Start

Do the following:

1. Create a [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account if you do not have one.

1. [Set up the AppDynamics Controller](#set-up-appd-controller).


## <a id='set-up-appd-controller'></a> Set Up the AppDynamics Controller

Do the following:

1. [Define an Application and Tier in the Controller](#define-app-and-tier).

1. [Determine the Tier ID](#determine-app-id).

### <a id='define-app-and-tier'></a> Define an Application and Tier in the Controller

1. Log in to the Controller.

1. Go to the Applications page. At the top of the table, click **Create Application**.

  * **Controller Configuration Name**
  * **Controller Configuration Description**
  * **Account Name** -- This is the account name used to access the Controller
  * **Account Access Key** -- In the Controller, click the gear icon  and choose **License > Account > Access Key**. If the Account Access Key includes one or more `$` characters, append a second `$` to every `$` included in the key string and surround the entire string with single quotes (').
  * **Controller Host**
  * **Controller Port**
  * **SSL Port** -- Do not enable.

## <a id='SSL'></a> Configuring SSL

### <a id='SAAS'></a> SSL for SAAS AppDyanmics Controllers
  
AppDynamics SAAS controller use DigiCert Global Root CA. The tile automatically imports the DigiCert Global Root CA into the keystore used by AppDynamics Machine agent and the dashboard application, if present. 
  
Check the SSL checkbox in AppDynamics Machine agent configuration. 

### <a id='OnPrem'></a> SSL for OnPremise AppDyanmics Controllers
  
For OnPremise Controller deployments, upload the root certificate for the internal CA that signed the Controller certificate for your OnPremise Controller in the secutiry configuration of the OpsManager Director. 
  
For an example, see the [Security Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/vsphere-config.html#security-config) section of the _Configuring Ops Manager Director on vSphere_ topic in the PCF documentation.

Make sure to follow the exact format below while entering multiple certificates.
