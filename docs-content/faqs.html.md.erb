## <a id='GeneralFAQs'></a> General FAQs
### <a id='g1'></a> <a id='g1'></a> What is included in Appdynamics Tile?
   * Appdynamics Service Broker (for application instrumentation)
   * Appdynamics Machine Agent (for collecting PCF metrics through a custom Nozzle from loggregator)
   * Appdynamics PCF Dashboard (An autogenerated custom dashboard, that creates healthrules for the above PCF metrics and neatly presents it) 
   * Appdynamics Analytics (for transaction analytics)

### <a id='g2'></a> <a id='g1'></a> I am just interested in APM. Should I configure Machine Agent and Transactional Analytics?
   *  For now please provide dummy values in the tile forms. We are working with Pivotal to release a lighter APM only product soon.       

### <a id='g3'></a> How do I configure SSL (On Prem controller deployment) ?
   *  Please make sure you have included the entire certificate chain in the security config 
    of the OpsManager director tile. This will ensure that all BOSH deployments and Diego        cells has access to those certificates automatically while doing SSL validation
   *  Appdynamics deployments automatically reads the certificates, imports them into correct       key stores. No additional steps are needed.
   *  Please follow the exact format (no commnets) as specified in the Pivotal OpsManager        documentation
   *  Make sure you check the all SSL check boxes in Tile Configuration Forms 

### <a id='g4'></a> How do I configure SSL (SAAS deployment)?
   *   Appdynamics SAAS controller are signed with standard     DigiCerts CA. They are already included in the BOSH deployments and applicaiton containers
   *   Just make sure you check the all SSL check boxes in Tile Configuration Forms

### <a id='g5'></a> My installation failed, what do I provide to Appdynamics support?
   *  Please collect the error logs from OpsManager installation page and please provide the entire deployment log 

## <a id='SBFAQS'></a> Appdynamics Service Broker and Buildpacks - APM FAQs
### <a id='s1'></a> What is Appdynamics Service Broker?
   *  Appdynamics Service Broker implements Service Broker API (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker) and provides a credential service for applications to bind (https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/services/overview.html). When bound the necessary appdynamics configuration is automatically imported into the applications environment for buildpacks to read and configure appdynamics agents. 
### <a id='s2'></a> Can I bind to appdynamics without service broker and still instrument applications? (CUPS)
   *  Yes you can bind a user provided service by creating a user provided service 
   *  `cf cups {service_name}  -p '{"account-access-key":"{access key}", "account-name":"{account}", "application-name":"{app}", "host-name":"{host}", "plan-description": "{plan}", "plan-name": "{name}", "port":"{port}", "ssl-enabled":{true|false}}'  `
   * Edit the values `{}` and execute the above command, that creates a user provided service 
   * Bind the application to user provided service and restage
 
### <a id='s3'></a> What language buildpacks have appdynamics support included?
  * The following buildpacks are supported. The [AppDynamics documentation for Pivotal] (https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PCF) includes several step-by-step example workflows with sample applications.

### <a id='s4'></a> I have a deployement with no internet access, how do I push the applications?
  * Customers can use java_buildpack shipped with CF environments directly. The appdynamics support has been merged a long time back. Any java_buildpack version that has been released after Nov 2017 should do. 
  * On top of that they have to do to place appdynamics agent downloaded from packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml using the procedure
    so that it fetches the dependencies locally. See `https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#offline-package`

### <a id='s5'></a> How do I customize AppName, TierName, NodeName?
  * Appdynamics Buildpacks autogenerates App/Tier/Node names by looking into the deployed environment. However one can customize it by setting the configuration environment variables
  * Please override the following env by doing a `cf set-env {APP} {ENVNAME} {ENVVALUE}` 
  
    |AGENT|	APPLICATION ENV VARIABLE|	TIER ENV VARIABLE|	NODE ENV VARIABLE|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Python|	APPD_APP_NAME|	APPD_TIER_NAME|	APPD_NODE_NAME|
    |Java|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_TIER_NAME|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_NODE_NAME|
    |NodeJS|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_TIER_NAME| APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_NODE_NAME|
    |Golang|	APPD_APP_NAME|	APPD_TIER_NAME|	APPD_NODE_NAME|

### <a id='s6'></a> How do I configure Java Buildpack to fetch a particular agent version?
  * By default, Buildpack fetches the latest available agent entry in `packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml `
  * You can override the default behavior by setting these variables specified (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/framework-app_dynamics_agent.md#configuration)
  * To use a specific version, just set the env JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT
     + `cf set-env {YOUR_APP_NAME} JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT '{version: 4.4.111}'`
  * To use another package index, just set the env JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT
     + `cf set-env {YOUR_APP_NAME} JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT '{repository_root: "https://exmple.duckdns.org"}' `

### <a id='s7'></a> Java buildpack is failing to fetch a particular agent version, what should I do?
  * if you are using the default package index. Please verify the version in question is present in the output of following command. 
    +  `curl -sSL https://packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml -H "user-agent: Ruby" -H "accept-encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3" -H "accept: */*"`
  * If not then please try opening https://packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml through a browser
  * If it is showing up in the browser output but not curl please reach out to appdynamics support (or) #java-buildpack channel of cloudfoundry slack 
   
### <a id='s8'></a> My application push fails, what do I provide to Appdynamics support?

  * cf push logs 
  * Application manifest (if present)

### <a id='s9'></a> My application is running, however I donot see any metrics on Controller. How do I troubleshoot?

  *  Do a `cf env application` and see if the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable has appdynamics info. If not, please bind the application to appdynamics service and restage  If yes, please make all the credentials (controller info, key, ssl) are correctly set. If there is SSL make sure ssl: true in `VCAP_SERVICES`

### <a id='s10'></a> What do I provide to Appdynamics Support ?
  * cf logs {appname}
  * cf env {appname}
  * cf ssh {appname}
      + figure out the process id of the running application by doing `ps aux` 
      + cat /proc/{pid}/environ
      + Agent logs

    | AGENT  | LOGS  |

## <a id='PCFDashboardFAQS'></a> Appdynamics PCF Dashboard FAQs
### <a id='d1'></a> What is PCF Dashboard?
  * The PCF Dashboard Generator is a Python 3 application that generates a platform dashboard and set of health rules for PCF foundations that have installed the Appd Tile v4.4.x. The generated dashboard and health rules leverage the custom metrics published by the Appd Tile to the AppD controller and application configured in the Appd Tile
   
### <a id='d2'></a> Where do I find this dashboard?
 * The dashboard can be found in Dashboards and Reports page of the controller, with a name `{appname}-{tiername}-PCF KPI Dashboard`  where appname and tiername are the names of machine agent application and tier name we have configured in the tile.      
 
### <a id='d3'></a> How is this dashboard getting created? 
   * The dashboard application reads the KPI metrics emitted by machine agent in the tile and associates them with various auto generated healthrules and renders a neat custom dashboard.

### <a id='d4'></a> What is the required RBAC for the accout used for dashboard configuration?
   * TODO

### <a id='d5'></a> I dont see this dashboard, how do I troubleshoot?
   * make sure the application is deployed properly. You should see `appdpcfdashboard-version` running. 

  ```bash
      pavan.krishna@OSXLTPKrishna:~/appdy$ cf target -o appdynamics-org -s appdynamics-space
      pavan.krishna@OSXLTPKrishna:~/appdy$ cf apps
