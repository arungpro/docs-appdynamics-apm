title: AppDynamics Application Performance Monitoring for PCF
owner: Partners
---

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

To simplify APM setup, the [AppDynamics Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-appdynamics/) (PCF) tile delivers a
service broker to support an AppDynamics marketplace service. The Controller parameters are
configured in the tile and automatically published to the marketplace when the tile is installed.

A PCF app can be bound to the marketplace service to consume the Controller credentials.

````
$ cf bind my-pcf-app my-appd-marketplace-service
````

Performing a push will utilize the integrated AppDynamics buildpack support to start the APM agent
based on the parameters from the marketplace service and start sending performance metrics to the
Controller.

````
$ cf push
````

The tile also installs the AppDynamics extension buildpack in the PCF environment. For more
information see the [buildpack support](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/appdynamics/multibuildpack.html)
and [language-specific workflows](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/appdynamics/using.html#workflows) sections to enable APM.
