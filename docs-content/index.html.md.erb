## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The AppDynamics integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) allows you to easily deploy AppDynamics-monitored applications on the [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

AppDynamics APM supports performance monitoring of application metrics. AppDynamics agent code embedded or bundled with an application instruments the application code and publishes performance monitoring metrics and other details back to the Application Dashboard in the AppDynamics Controller web UI.

* Upgrades from AppDynamics v1.x are not supported. If you previously installed AppDynamics v1.x, uninstall it and install the latest version.

* The tile cannot be used for OpsManager with cf < v2.0.7 since the Loggregator component (reverse_log_proxy) needed 
for extracting the KPI metrics is not exposed.
