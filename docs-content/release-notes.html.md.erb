##### Features

This major release now contains AppDynamics Machine Agent and an extension that talks to a custom nozzle and collects KPI metrics of the cloud-foundry environment.
Also, a dashboard application is included that automatically generates the custom dashboard on AppDynamics Controller. For more information, see [AppDynamics KPI Dashboard and Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/appdynamics/kpi-dashboard.html).

The tile contains:

- AppDynamics Service Broker, for instrumentation of applications
- AppDynamics Machine Agent, for collecting KPI metrics through Loggregator
- AppDynamics Dashboard Application, for displaying the above collected metrics in a neat UI dashboard on controller

### Limitations

The tile requires:

- PCF Ops Manager: v2.0.7 or higher, or any v2.1.x or v2.2.x versions

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Please note that the tile cannot be used for OpsManager with cf < v2.0.7 since the Loggregator component (reverse_log_proxy) needed for extracting the KPI metrics is not exposed.</p>
